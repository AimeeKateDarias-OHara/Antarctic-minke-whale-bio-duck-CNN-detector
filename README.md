Antarctic minke whale machine learning detector
Darias-O’Hara et al. (In review)
Overview of the detector 
This detector was developed using Koogu v0.7.2 (Madhusudhana, 2023), an open-source framework for machine learning from bioacoustics datasets, based on TensorFlow 2.9.0 framework (TensorFlow Developers, 2022) and Python 3.10 (Python Software Foundation, 2021). A quasi-DenseNet CNN architecture was selected. 
Audio files were segmented into 10 s clips, with a 0.5 s clip advance; audio clips were then downsampled to 1000 Hz and passed through a 9th order Butterworth bandpass filter between 50 and 250 Hz. Spectrograms were generated utilising a 0.175 s time window and 75% overlap between time slices. A minimum annotation overlap of 60% was implemented to ensure each audio clip contained a sufficient portion of annotations. A total of 243,143 bio-duck (BD) class and 427,656 ‘other’ (biological and anthropogenic sounds) class spectrograms constituted model training inputs. 50,000 samples were randomly selected from each class to significantly reduce both training and evaluation times. 
The resulting spectrograms were partitioned into training and validation datasets with an 85/15% training/validation split. The quasi-DenseNet CNN architecture consisted of four dense blocks with four layers each, and growth rate k = 8. A 2D convolutional layer with 16 filters was applied and a final dense layer with 16 units. A total of 50 epochs were used for training, with validation conducted at every 5th epoch. The initial learning rate was set to 0.01 and reduced by a factor of 10 at epoch 20, and a further factor of 10 at epoch 40. A dropout rate of 0.05 was implemented to promote generalisation and reduce overfitting. 
This detector identifies Antarctic minke whale bio-duck vocalisations. Positive detections are labelled as “BD” under the “Tags” column in the resulting RavenPro selections tables.  
System requirements
This detector can run on Linux, macOS, or Windows with Python 3.8–3.11 and standard scientific libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, soundfile, plus PyTorch or TensorFlow). Ensure that koogu is installed. Whilst it will work on a CPU, using an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is recommended for much faster processing, especially when working with large audio datasets or training models.
Quick start guide 
Koogu documentation and quick start guide is available here (https://shyamblast.github.io/Koogu/en/v0.7.1/quickstart.html). 
Two .py scripts are provided alongside the detector. These include “find_Aminke.py” and “adjust_koogu_selection_boxes.py”. Additionally, a folder “Aminke_DetectorFiles” is provided, containing the model and required documentation. 
For large datasets, it is recommended that the audio be split into monthly folders as the detector will run recursively (when recursive = True in find_Aminke.py) and provide a RavenPro selections table for each month (when combine_outputs = True in find_Aminke.py). 
To use this detector, first set up find_Aminke.py to your directories and settings. 
Post processing of selections tables 
Once the detector run is complete, use “adjust_selection_boxes.py” to align the Koogu outputs (RavenPro selections tables) with the full audio timeline when detections span across multiple audio files. This script scans the target audio folder, calculates the duration of each file, and builds a cumulative offset map so each file’s start time is correctly placed on the global timeline. The script then loads the selections table .txt file, adjusts the “Begin Time” and “End Time” values by adding the correct file offset, and outputs a new corrected detection table (AdjustedSelections.txt). To use it, specify the audio folder path containing the .wav files and the Koogu detection file path, then run the script. The result ensures that detections line up properly when visualized in RavenPro 1.6.
